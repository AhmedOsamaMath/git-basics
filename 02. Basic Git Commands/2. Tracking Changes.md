# Tracking Changes

Tracking changes in Git is essential to manage your files and monitor modifications. This page explains how Git tracks changes and how to use commands to manage your projectâ€™s history effectively.

## Understanding Git's Tracking Process

When working with a Git repository:
1. **Untracked Files**: Files that Git does not yet know about.
2. **Tracked Files**: Files that Git is monitoring for changes. Tracked files can be:
   - **Unmodified**: No changes since the last commit.
   - **Modified**: Changes have been made but not yet staged.
   - **Staged**: Changes are prepared for the next commit.

## 1. **Viewing Changes**

### **Check the Status of Your Files**
Use `git status` to see the current state of your files:
```bash
git status
```

### **Check Differences in Modified Files**
To view changes in files compared to the last commit:
```bash
git diff
```

### **Check Staged Differences**
To view changes that are staged for the next commit:
```bash
git diff --cached
```

---

## 2. **Tracking New Files**

To track new files, use the `git add` command:
```bash
git add filename
```

### **Track All New Files**
To stage all new and modified files:
```bash
git add .
```

### **Add Files by Pattern**
You can add specific file types:
```bash
git add *.txt
```

---

## 3. **Updating Tracked Files**

If a tracked file is modified, stage the changes:
```bash
git add filename
```

---

## 4. **Ignoring Files**

Use a `.gitignore` file to prevent certain files or directories from being tracked:
1. Create a `.gitignore` file in your repository:
   ```bash
   touch .gitignore
   ```
2. Add patterns for files to ignore. For example:
   ```
   # Ignore log files
   *.log
   
   # Ignore temporary files
   *.tmp
   ```
3. Save the file and commit it:
   ```bash
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Add .gitignore file"
   ```

---

## 5. **Untracking Files**

If you no longer want Git to track a file:
1. Remove it from tracking without deleting it:
   ```bash
   git rm --cached filename
   ```
2. Commit the change:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Stop tracking filename"
   ```

---

## 6. **Commit Changes**

Once files are staged, commit them to save a snapshot of your changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
```

## Common Scenarios

| Scenario                              | Command                                   |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| View the current status               | `git status`                              |
| View changes in the working directory | `git diff`                                |
| Stage a single file                   | `git add filename`                        |
| Stage all changes                     | `git add .`                               |
| Commit staged changes                 | `git commit -m "message"`                 |
| Stop tracking a file                  | `git rm --cached filename`                |
| Ignore files using `.gitignore`       | Add patterns to `.gitignore` and commit it|

## Example Workflow

1. Modify a file:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, Git!" > hello.txt
   ```

2. Check the status:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

3. Stage the file:
   ```bash
   git add hello.txt
   ```

4. Commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add hello.txt with a greeting"
   ```

## Conclusion

Tracking changes is a fundamental part of working with Git. By understanding how Git handles file states and using commands like `git status`, `git add`, and `git commit`, you can efficiently manage your project and maintain a clean version history.
