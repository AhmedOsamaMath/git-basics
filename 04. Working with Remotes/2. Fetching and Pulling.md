# Fetching and Pulling

In Git, **fetching** and **pulling** are commands used to synchronize your local repository with a remote repository. This page explains the difference between them and how to use them effectively.

---

## 1. **What is Fetching?**

Fetching downloads the latest changes from the remote repository but does not apply them to your working directory or local branch.

### Key Points:
- Downloads commits, branches, and tags from the remote.
- Updates the remote tracking branches (e.g., `origin/main`).
- Does **not** modify your current branch.

---

## 2. **What is Pulling?**

Pulling is a combination of two actions:
1. **Fetch**: Downloads changes from the remote.
2. **Merge**: Integrates the changes into your current branch.

### Key Points:
- Updates your working directory with the latest changes.
- Automatically merges changes into your branch.

---

## 3. **When to Use Fetching vs. Pulling**

- **Use Fetching** when you want to review the changes before merging them.
- **Use Pulling** when you're ready to update your local branch with the latest changes from the remote.

---

## 4. **Fetching Changes**

### Fetch Updates from a Remote
To fetch updates without applying them:
```bash
git fetch origin
```

### View Fetched Changes
Check the differences between your branch and the remote branch:
```bash
git diff origin/main
```

### List Remote Branches
After fetching, view all remote branches:
```bash
git branch -r
```

---

## 5. **Pulling Changes**

### Pull Updates from a Remote
To fetch and merge changes into your current branch:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### Pull with Rebase
Instead of merging, you can rebase your changes on top of the fetched commits:
```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```

---

## 6. **Resolving Conflicts During Pull**

If there are conflicts when pulling:
1. Git will pause and notify you of the conflicting files.
2. Resolve the conflicts manually in your text editor.
3. Stage the resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add resolved_file.txt
   ```
4. Complete the merge:
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

---

## 7. **Example Workflow**

### Step 1: Fetch Changes
Fetch updates from the remote repository:
```bash
git fetch origin
```

### Step 2: Review Changes
Compare your branch with the fetched updates:
```bash
git diff origin/main
```

### Step 3: Pull Changes
If the changes are acceptable, pull them into your branch:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

## 8. **Best Practices for Fetching and Pulling**

- **Fetch Frequently**: Regularly fetch updates to stay informed about changes in the remote repository.
- **Pull Before Pushing**: Always pull the latest changes from the remote branch before pushing your changes:
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  git push origin main
  ```
- **Resolve Conflicts Early**: Address conflicts as soon as they arise to avoid larger issues later.

## Common Commands for Fetching and Pulling

| Command                             | Description                                      |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `git fetch origin`                  | Fetch updates from the remote repository.        |
| `git pull origin branch_name`       | Fetch and merge changes into the current branch. |
| `git diff origin/branch_name`       | Compare your branch with the remote branch.      |
| `git pull --rebase origin branch_name` | Fetch and rebase changes onto your branch.       |

## 9. **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What Happens If I Forget to Pull Before Pushing?**
If the remote branch has new commits, Git will reject your push. You'll need to pull and resolve any conflicts before pushing again.

### **Can I Fetch from Multiple Remotes?**
Yes, you can fetch from multiple remotes by specifying the remote name:
```bash
git fetch remote_name
```
