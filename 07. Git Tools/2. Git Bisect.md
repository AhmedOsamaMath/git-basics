# Git Bisect

**Git Bisect** is a powerful debugging tool that helps you find the commit that introduced a bug by performing a binary search through your project’s commit history.

---

## 1. **What is Git Bisect?**

Git bisect identifies the "bad" commit (the one that introduced the bug) by splitting the range of commits into halves and testing each until the problematic commit is found.

### Key Points:
- Efficiently locates the commit causing an issue.
- Automates the debugging process by narrowing down the commit range.

---

## 2. **When to Use Git Bisect**

- **Bug Identification**: When a previously working feature breaks.
- **Regression Testing**: To pinpoint the commit introducing a regression.
- **Collaborative Projects**: To debug issues introduced by changes in a team environment.

---

## 3. **How Git Bisect Works**

1. **Start Bisecting**: Mark the current commit as bad (bug present).
2. **Identify a Good Commit**: Specify the last known good commit (bug not present).
3. **Test Commits**: Git checks out a commit in the middle of the range for testing.
4. **Mark Results**: You mark each commit as good or bad based on your tests.
5. **Locate the Bad Commit**: Git narrows the range until the problematic commit is found.

## 4. **Using Git Bisect**

### Step 1: Start Bisecting
```bash
git bisect start
```

### Step 2: Mark the Current Commit as Bad
```bash
git bisect bad
```

### Step 3: Mark a Known Good Commit
Identify a commit where the bug wasn’t present:
```bash
git bisect good <commit-hash>
```

### Step 4: Test Each Commit
Git checks out a commit for you to test. After testing:
- If the bug is present, mark the commit as bad:
  ```bash
  git bisect bad
  ```
- If the bug is not present, mark the commit as good:
  ```bash
  git bisect good
  ```

### Step 5: Repeat Until the Bad Commit is Found
Git continues the process until it identifies the problematic commit. You’ll see output like:
```
<commit-hash> is the first bad commit
```

---

## 5. **Automating Bisect**

You can automate testing with a script. For example:
1. Write a script that returns `0` for good and `1` for bad.
2. Run bisect with the script:
   ```bash
   git bisect run ./test-script.sh
   ```

---

## 6. **Ending Bisect**

Once the bad commit is found, reset your repository to the original state:
```bash
git bisect reset
```

---

## 7. **Example Workflow**

### Scenario
You notice a bug in your project after a recent commit. You know the bug wasn’t present five commits ago.

### Steps:
1. Start bisecting:
   ```bash
   git bisect start
   ```

2. Mark the current commit as bad:
   ```bash
   git bisect bad
   ```

3. Mark the last known good commit:
   ```bash
   git bisect good HEAD~5
   ```

4. Test each commit:
   - If the bug is present:
     ```bash
     git bisect bad
     ```
   - If the bug is absent:
     ```bash
     git bisect good
     ```

5. Git identifies the first bad commit:
   ```
   <commit-hash> is the first bad commit
   ```

6. Reset your repository:
   ```bash
   git bisect reset
   ```

## 8. **Best Practices for Using Git Bisect**

- **Automate Testing**: Use scripts to speed up the process for projects with consistent test criteria.
- **Document Findings**: Record the cause of the issue and steps to resolve it after identifying the bad commit.
- **Use Tags or Messages**: Use descriptive commit messages or tags to help you identify meaningful points in the history.

## 9. **Common Commands**

| Command                           | Description                                      |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `git bisect start`                | Start the bisect process.                       |
| `git bisect bad`                  | Mark the current commit as bad.                 |
| `git bisect good <commit-hash>`   | Mark a specific commit as good.                 |
| `git bisect run <script>`         | Automate testing with a script.                 |
| `git bisect reset`                | End the bisect process and reset to the original state. |

## 10. **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Can I Bisect Across Multiple Branches?**
Yes, as long as the commits in question are part of the same repository history.

### **What Happens If I Mark the Wrong Commit?**
You can restart the bisect process using:
```bash
git bisect reset
```

## Conclusion

Git bisect is a valuable tool for identifying the source of bugs or regressions efficiently. By combining manual or automated testing with Git’s binary search algorithm, you can debug faster and maintain project stability.
