# Git Hooks

**Git Hooks** are scripts that run automatically at specific points in a Git workflow. They allow you to automate tasks, enforce rules, or integrate with other tools.

---

## 1. **What are Git Hooks?**

Git hooks are customizable scripts that Git executes before or after specific events, such as commits, merges, or pushes. Hooks reside in the `.git/hooks` directory of a repository and can be tailored to meet your workflow requirements.

---

## 2. **Types of Git Hooks**

### **Client-Side Hooks**
These run on the developer’s machine and are triggered by actions like committing, merging, or pushing.

Examples:
- `pre-commit`: Runs before a commit is created.
- `commit-msg`: Validates or formats commit messages.
- `pre-push`: Executes before pushing changes to a remote repository.

### **Server-Side Hooks**
These run on the server and are triggered by events like receiving a push.

Examples:
- `pre-receive`: Validates incoming changes before they are applied.
- `post-receive`: Triggers actions like deploying code after a push.
- `update`: Checks changes to individual branches during a push.

## 3. **Common Git Hooks**

| Hook             | Description                                     | Trigger Event                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `pre-commit`      | Validates changes before committing.           | `git commit`                           |
| `commit-msg`      | Validates the commit message format.            | `git commit`                           |
| `post-commit`     | Runs tasks after a commit is created.           | `git commit`                           |
| `pre-push`        | Runs checks before pushing to a remote.         | `git push`                             |
| `pre-receive`     | Validates incoming changes on the server.       | `git push` to a remote repository.     |
| `post-receive`    | Runs tasks like CI/CD after a push is received. | `git push` to a remote repository.     |

## 4. **Setting Up Git Hooks**

### Step 1: Navigate to the Hooks Directory
The hooks directory is located at:
```bash
.git/hooks
```

### Step 2: Create or Edit a Hook
1. Rename the sample hook file (e.g., `pre-commit.sample`) to remove the `.sample` extension:
   ```bash
   mv .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

2. Open the file in a text editor:
   ```bash
   nano .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

3. Add your script logic.

### Step 3: Make the Hook Executable
```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## 5. **Example Git Hooks**

### **Pre-Commit Hook: Code Linter**
Run a linter to ensure code quality before committing:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run ESLint on staged files
FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep '\.js$')
if [ -n "$FILES" ]; then
  eslint $FILES
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Linting failed. Commit aborted."
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

### **Commit Message Hook: Enforce Format**
Ensure commit messages follow a specific format:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Enforce commit message format
MESSAGE=$(cat $1)
if ! [[ $MESSAGE =~ ^[A-Z]+\-[0-9]+\: ]]; then
  echo "Commit message must start with JIRA ID (e.g., PROJ-123: Fix bug)"
  exit 1
fi
```

### **Post-Commit Hook: Notify Team**
Send a Slack notification after a commit:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Send a notification to Slack
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
--data '{"text":"New commit pushed: '"$(git log -1 --pretty=%B)"'"}' \
https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK
```

## 6. **Sharing Hooks Across Teams**

Git hooks are not version-controlled by default. To share hooks:
1. Store them in a directory, such as `.githooks/`.
2. Use `core.hooksPath` to point Git to the shared directory:
   ```bash
   git config core.hooksPath .githooks
   ```

---

## 7. **Best Practices**

- **Keep Hooks Simple**: Avoid writing overly complex scripts.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure hooks work correctly and don’t disrupt workflows.
- **Document Hooks**: Clearly document what each hook does and how to disable or modify it.
- **Use for Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks like linting, formatting, or notifying teams.

---

## 8. **Common Commands**

| Command                           | Description                                    |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `chmod +x .git/hooks/<hook-name>` | Make the hook script executable.               |
| `git config core.hooksPath <path>`| Set a custom directory for hooks.              |
| `ls .git/hooks`                   | List all available hooks.                      |

---

## 9. **When to Avoid Using Hooks**

- **Non-Portable Tasks**: Hooks are not shared by default, so tasks that need to run across teams are better suited for CI/CD pipelines.
- **Critical Logic**: Avoid placing critical business logic in hooks since they can be bypassed.

---

## Conclusion

Git hooks are powerful for automating tasks, enforcing rules, and improving workflows. By using hooks effectively, you can save time, ensure consistency, and enhance team collaboration.
