# Branch Basics

Branches in Git are a powerful feature that allow you to work on different parts of a project simultaneously without affecting the main codebase. This page explains the basics of branches and how to use them effectively.

---

## 1. **What is a Branch?**

A branch in Git is a pointer to a specific commit in your projectâ€™s history. It enables you to:
- Develop features or fix bugs in isolation.
- Experiment without disrupting the main codebase.
- Collaborate on separate tasks within a team.

### Default Branch
When you initialize a Git repository, a default branch is created. It is usually named `main` or `master`.

---

## 2. **Why Use Branches?**

- **Isolation**: Keep changes for new features or bug fixes separate from the main project.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple team members can work on different branches simultaneously.
- **Versioning**: Easily switch between different versions or states of your project.

## 3. **Working with Branches**

### **View Existing Branches**
To list all branches in your repository:
```bash
git branch
```

### **Create a New Branch**
To create a new branch:
```bash
git branch branch_name
```

### **Switch to a Branch**
To move to an existing branch:
```bash
git checkout branch_name
```

Or, create and switch to a new branch in one command:
```bash
git checkout -b branch_name
```

---

## 4. **Managing Branches**

### **Rename a Branch**
To rename the branch you are currently on:
```bash
git branch -m new_branch_name
```

### **Delete a Branch**
To delete a branch locally:
```bash
git branch -d branch_name
```
Use `-D` to force-delete a branch:
```bash
git branch -D branch_name
```

---

## 5. **Merging Branches**

Merging integrates changes from one branch into another. For example, merging a feature branch into `main`:
1. Switch to the target branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Merge the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git merge feature_branch
   ```

### **Resolve Merge Conflicts**
If there are conflicts during merging:
1. Open the affected files and resolve the conflicts.
2. Mark conflicts as resolved:
   ```bash
   git add file_with_conflicts
   ```
3. Complete the merge:
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

## 6. **Viewing Branch History**

To see a graphical view of branches and commits:
```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

---

## 7. **Best Practices for Branching**

- **Use Descriptive Names**: Name branches based on their purpose, e.g., `feature/user-auth` or `bugfix/login-error`.
- **Work Incrementally**: Make small, manageable changes on branches.
- **Keep `main` Stable**: Only merge tested and working code into the main branch.
- **Regularly Sync with `main`**: Pull the latest changes from `main` into your branch to avoid large conflicts.

## Common Commands

| Command                            | Description                                     |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `git branch`                       | List all branches.                             |
| `git branch branch_name`           | Create a new branch.                           |
| `git checkout branch_name`         | Switch to an existing branch.                  |
| `git checkout -b branch_name`      | Create and switch to a new branch.             |
| `git merge branch_name`            | Merge a branch into the current branch.        |
| `git branch -d branch_name`        | Delete a branch.                               |
| `git log --oneline --graph --all`  | View a graphical history of branches.          |

## Example Workflow

### Step 1: Create and Switch to a New Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

### Step 2: Make Changes and Commit
```bash
echo "New feature code" > feature.txt
git add feature.txt
git commit -m "Add new feature"
```

### Step 3: Merge the Branch into `main`
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-feature
```

### Step 4: Delete the Feature Branch
```bash
git branch -d feature/new-feature
```

## Conclusion

Branches are an essential part of Git workflows, allowing you to isolate changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a clean and stable codebase. Mastering branch management is key to efficient version control.
