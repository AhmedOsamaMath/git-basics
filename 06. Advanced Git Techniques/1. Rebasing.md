# Rebasing

**Rebasing** is a Git operation that moves a branch to a new base commit. It allows you to maintain a cleaner and more linear project history by integrating changes from one branch into another.

---

## 1. **What is Rebasing?**

Rebasing rewrites the commit history of a branch by applying its changes on top of another branch. Unlike merging, which creates a new merge commit, rebasing integrates commits into a single, linear sequence.

---

## 2. **When to Use Rebasing**

- **Clean History**: Rebasing creates a straight-line history, making it easier to understand and review.
- **Feature Development**: Use rebasing to keep feature branches up-to-date with the `main` branch.
- **Avoid Merge Commits**: Rebasing avoids extra merge commits in the history.

---

## 3. **How Rebasing Works**

### Example:
Consider the following branches:

```
main:    A --- B --- C
feature:         D --- E
```

When rebasing `feature` onto `main`, the commits `D` and `E` are replayed on top of `main`:

```
main:    A --- B --- C --- D' --- E'
```

---

## 4. **Performing a Rebase**

### Rebasing Onto Another Branch
1. Switch to the branch you want to rebase:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature
   ```

2. Rebase it onto the target branch (e.g., `main`):
   ```bash
   git rebase main
   ```

### Resolving Conflicts During Rebase
If conflicts occur:
1. Git pauses the rebase and marks the conflicting files.
2. Resolve the conflicts manually in your editor.
3. Mark conflicts as resolved:
   ```bash
   git add resolved_file.txt
   ```

4. Continue the rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

To abort the rebase:
```bash
git rebase --abort
```

## 5. **Interactive Rebasing**

Interactive rebasing allows you to edit, squash, or reorder commits.

### Start an Interactive Rebase
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~n
```
- Replace `n` with the number of commits you want to rebase.

### Options in Interactive Rebase
- `pick`: Keep the commit as-is.
- `edit`: Edit the commit message or content.
- `squash`: Combine the commit with the previous one.
- `reword`: Change the commit message.

### Example Workflow
1. Start an interactive rebase for the last 3 commits:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~3
   ```

2. Change the options in the editor, then save and close.

3. Complete the rebase, resolving any conflicts if needed.

## 6. **Best Practices for Rebasing**

- **Rebase Before Pushing**: Ensure you havenâ€™t shared the branch with others before rebasing.
- **Use for Local Changes**: Avoid rebasing shared branches to prevent rewriting history others rely on.
- **Keep Backups**: Create a backup branch before rebasing to avoid accidental data loss.

## 7. **Rebase vs. Merge**

| Feature           | Rebase                           | Merge                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Commit History    | Linear                          | Includes merge commits           |
| Complexity        | Rewrites history                | Preserves history as-is          |
| Use Case          | Cleaning up commits, small teams| Maintaining complete history, large teams|

## 8. **Common Commands**

| Command                          | Description                                       |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `git rebase branch_name`         | Rebase the current branch onto another branch.    |
| `git rebase --continue`          | Continue a paused rebase after resolving conflicts.|
| `git rebase --abort`             | Cancel the rebase and return to the original state.|
| `git rebase -i HEAD~n`           | Start an interactive rebase for the last `n` commits.|

---

## 9. **Example Workflow**

### Step 1: Update a Feature Branch
1. Switch to the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature
   ```

2. Rebase onto `main`:
   ```bash
   git rebase main
   ```

3. Resolve conflicts (if any) and continue:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

## 10. **When to Avoid Rebasing**

- **On Public Branches**: Rebasing rewrites history, which can confuse collaborators.
- **If Unsure**: Use merging instead of rebasing if you're new to Git or uncertain about rewriting history.

---

## Conclusion

Rebasing is a powerful Git feature for maintaining a clean and linear commit history. By using it responsibly and understanding its implications, you can simplify collaboration and code reviews.
