# Cherry-Picking

**Cherry-picking** in Git allows you to apply specific commits from one branch to another without merging the entire branch. This is useful for selectively integrating changes.

---

## 1. **What is Cherry-Picking?**

Cherry-picking is the process of taking a specific commit from one branch and applying it to another. It lets you:
- Pick individual commits without merging the entire branch.
- Fix bugs or apply changes from one branch to another selectively.

---

## 2. **When to Use Cherry-Picking**

- **Bug Fixes**: Apply a critical fix from a feature branch to `main`.
- **Selective Features**: Bring specific features or updates from another branch.
- **Undo Mistakes**: Reapply changes from a reverted commit.

---

## 3. **How Cherry-Picking Works**

### Syntax
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

### Example
Consider the following branches:

#### `feature` branch:
```
A --- B --- C (HEAD)
```

#### `main` branch:
```
X --- Y --- Z (HEAD)
```

If you cherry-pick commit `B` from `feature` to `main`, the result is:

```
X --- Y --- Z --- B'
```

---

## 4. **Performing a Cherry-Pick**

### Step 1: Identify the Commit
List the commits in the source branch:
```bash
git log --oneline
```
Copy the hash of the commit you want to cherry-pick.

### Step 2: Cherry-Pick the Commit
Switch to the target branch and apply the commit:
```bash
git checkout main
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

### Step 3: Resolve Conflicts (if any)
If conflicts arise:
1. Open and resolve the conflicting files.
2. Stage the resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add resolved_file.txt
   ```
3. Complete the cherry-pick:
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick --continue
   ```

To abort the cherry-pick:
```bash
git cherry-pick --abort
```

## 5. **Cherry-Picking Multiple Commits**

To cherry-pick multiple commits:
1. Use individual hashes:
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <hash1> <hash2> <hash3>
   ```
2. Cherry-pick a range of commits:
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <hash1>^..<hash3>
   ```

---

## 6. **Undoing a Cherry-Pick**

If you need to undo a cherry-picked commit:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

---

## 7. **Interactive Cherry-Picking**

You can use interactive rebasing to cherry-pick commits:
1. Start an interactive rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i <base-branch>
   ```
2. Select and reorder the commits you want to apply.

---

## 8. **Best Practices for Cherry-Picking**

- **Minimize Conflicts**: Keep the source and target branches up-to-date to reduce conflicts.
- **Document the Reason**: Use meaningful commit messages to explain why the commit was cherry-picked.
- **Verify Changes**: Test the branch after cherry-picking to ensure functionality.

## 9. **Common Commands**

| Command                                | Description                                       |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `git cherry-pick <hash>`               | Apply a specific commit to the current branch.    |
| `git cherry-pick <hash1> <hash2>`      | Apply multiple commits.                          |
| `git cherry-pick <hash1>^..<hash2>`    | Apply a range of commits.                        |
| `git cherry-pick --continue`           | Continue after resolving conflicts.              |
| `git cherry-pick --abort`              | Cancel a cherry-pick.                            |

## 10. **Example Workflow**

### Step 1: Identify the Commit
Find the commit hash from the source branch:
```bash
git log feature --oneline
```

### Step 2: Switch to the Target Branch
```bash
git checkout main
```

### Step 3: Cherry-Pick the Commit
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

### Step 4: Test and Verify
Run tests to ensure the changes work as intended.

## 11. **When to Avoid Cherry-Picking**

- **Frequent Use**: Excessive cherry-picking can lead to a fragmented history.
- **Public Commits**: Avoid cherry-picking public commits that might cause confusion for collaborators.

---

## Conclusion

Cherry-picking is a powerful tool for applying specific commits across branches without merging. When used appropriately, it ensures targeted changes while maintaining control over your repository.
