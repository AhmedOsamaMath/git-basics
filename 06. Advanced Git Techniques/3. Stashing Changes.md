# Stashing Changes

**Stashing** in Git temporarily saves your uncommitted changes so you can switch branches or work on something else without losing your progress. This page explains how to use Git stash effectively.

---

## 1. **What is Stashing?**

Stashing allows you to:
- Save your working directoryâ€™s changes (tracked and untracked files) without committing them.
- Return to a clean state while preserving your progress for later.

### Key Points:
- Stashed changes are stored in a stack-like structure.
- You can apply or discard stashed changes at any time.

---

## 2. **Why Use Stashing?**

- **Context Switching**: Quickly switch branches to address an urgent issue.
- **Clean Environment**: Test or experiment in a clean working directory without committing temporary changes.
- **Organized Workflow**: Avoid unnecessary or incomplete commits.

## 3. **Basic Stashing Commands**

### Save Changes to Stash
To stash your changes:
```bash
git stash
```
This stashes:
- Modified tracked files.
- Staged changes.

### Stash with a Message
To add a description for your stash:
```bash
git stash push -m "Work in progress for feature X"
```

### View Stash List
To see all stashed changes:
```bash
git stash list
```
Example output:
```
stash@{0}: On feature: Work in progress for feature X
stash@{1}: On main: Temporary fix
```

---

## 4. **Applying Stashed Changes**

### Apply the Most Recent Stash
To apply changes from the latest stash:
```bash
git stash apply
```

### Apply a Specific Stash
To apply a specific stash by its identifier:
```bash
git stash apply stash@{1}
```

### Apply and Remove the Stash
To apply the changes and remove the stash from the list:
```bash
git stash pop
```

---

## 5. **Dropping or Clearing Stashes**

### Remove a Specific Stash
To delete a specific stash:
```bash
git stash drop stash@{0}
```

### Clear All Stashes
To remove all stashed changes:
```bash
git stash clear
```

---

## 6. **Stashing Untracked Files**

By default, `git stash` does not include untracked files. To stash untracked files:
```bash
git stash push -u
```
This includes untracked files in the stash.

To include both untracked and ignored files:
```bash
git stash push -a
```

---

## 7. **Example Workflow**

### Step 1: Work on a File
Modify a file in your working directory:
```bash
echo "Work in progress" >> file.txt
```

### Step 2: Stash the Changes
Save your changes:
```bash
git stash push -m "Work on feature X"
```

### Step 3: Switch Branches
Switch to another branch to work on something else:
```bash
git checkout main
```

### Step 4: Return to Your Work
Switch back to your branch and apply the stash:
```bash
git checkout feature
git stash apply
```

## 8. **Best Practices for Stashing**

- **Add Messages**: Use descriptive messages to identify stashes easily.
- **Keep Stash Clean**: Regularly review and clear unnecessary stashes.
- **Minimize Dependencies**: Avoid stashing for long periods as the base branch may change significantly.

## 10. **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What Happens If I Stash Multiple Times?**
Each stash is stored in a stack. You can access specific stashes using their identifiers, such as `stash@{0}`.

### **Can I Stash Changes Without Affecting Staged Files?**
Yes, use the `--keep-index` option to stash only unstaged changes:
```bash
git stash push --keep-index
```

## Conclusion

Stashing is a powerful tool for managing temporary changes, allowing you to switch contexts or clean up your working directory without committing incomplete work. By mastering stashing, you can maintain an efficient and organized workflow.
